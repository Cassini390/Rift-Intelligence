Project Files
File	Description
`index.html`	The frontend UI — handles search, displays all stats, charts, match history, and scoreboards
`server.js`	Local Node.js/Express proxy server that forwards requests to the Riot API
`package.json`	Node.js dependencies (Express, node-fetch, cors, dotenv)
`.env`	Your API key goes here — never committed to git
`.env.example`	Template showing the required environment variables
`.gitignore`	Prevents `.env` and `node\\\_modules` from being committed
`CHANGELOG.md`	Full version history
`README.md`	This file
---
Setup Instructions
1. Install Node.js
If you don't already have Node.js installed, download and install it from nodejs.org. The LTS version is recommended.
To check if it's already installed:
```
node -v
```
---
2. Download the Project Files
Place all files into the same folder on your computer:
```
lol-tracker/
├── index.html
├── server.js
├── package.json
├── .env
├── .env.example
├── .gitignore
├── CHANGELOG.md
└── README.md
```
---
3. Add Your API Key
Open the `.env` file in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, etc.) and replace the placeholder with your actual key:
```
RIOT\\\_API\\\_KEY=RGAPI-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
PORT=3000
```
Get a free key at developer.riotgames.com — log in, and click Generate API Key on the dashboard. The key starts with `RGAPI-`.
> \\\*\\\*Important:\\\*\\\* Keep your `.env` file private. It is listed in `.gitignore` so it will not be accidentally committed if you use git.
---
4. Open a Terminal in the Project Folder
Windows:
Open the folder in File Explorer
Click the address bar at the top
Type `cmd` and press Enter
Mac:
Open the folder in Finder
Right-click the folder and select New Terminal at Folder
Drag and drop method (either OS):
Open a terminal normally
Type `cd ` (with a space), then drag the project folder into the terminal window
Press Enter
---
5. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```
This installs Express, node-fetch, cors, and dotenv into a `node\\\_modules` folder. You only need to do this once (or again after deleting `node\\\_modules`).
---
6. Start the Server
```
node server.js
```
You should see:
```
LoL Tracker running at http://localhost:3000
```
Leave this terminal window open while using the tracker. To stop the server, press `Ctrl+C`.
---
7. Open the App
Navigate to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```
in your browser.
---
How to Use
Enter your summoner name and tag (the part after the `#` in your Riot ID — e.g. for `PlayerName#EUW` enter `PlayerName` and `EUW`)
Select your region from the dropdown
Click Search
Loading takes around 10–20 seconds as match data is fetched in batches to avoid hitting the API rate limit.
---
Renewing Your API Key
Free development keys expire every 24 hours. To renew:
Go to developer.riotgames.com and log in
Click Generate API Key on the dashboard — this replaces your old key
Open the `.env` file in your project folder and update the `RIOT\\\_API\\\_KEY` line with the new key
Stop the server (`Ctrl+C` in the terminal) and start it again with `node server.js`
The app will show a clear error message if the key is missing or expired.
---
Troubleshooting
Problem	Fix
`Cannot find module 'express'`	Run `npm install` in the project folder
`Cannot reach server`	Make sure `node server.js` is running in a terminal
`RIOT\\\_API\\\_KEY not configured`	Open `.env` and paste your API key in — see Add Your API Key
`API key expired`	Generate a new key at developer.riotgames.com, update `.env`, and restart the server
`Rate Limit Exceeded`	Wait 30 seconds and try again — the free dev key allows 100 requests per 2 minutes
No matches showing	Check your summoner name and tag are correct, and that the right region is selected
Wrong region	EUW accounts use the `EUW` region — make sure the dropdown matches your account's server

API Rate Limits
This project uses a free Riot development API key which has the following limits:
20 requests per second
100 requests per 2 minutes
Match data is fetched in batches of 5 with a short pause between each batch to stay within these limits. If you hit the rate limit, wait 30 seconds before searching again.

Version
Current version: v1.8 — see CHANGELOG.md for full history.
